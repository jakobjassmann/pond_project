## Content

This repository contains the scripts and tabular data needed to regenerate the analysis presented in Assmann et al (in prep). <br><br>
*Note: Additional raster data (drone imagery and DSMs) are requried. These are available on the Zenodo, see details below.*

## 2. Required data

To following data are not included in this code repository, but are required to regenerate the analysis.   

**Drone RGB images and DSM rasters**

**Assmann et al. 2024. Dataset for "Assmann et al. Freshwater ponds create highly dynamic Arctic tundra landscapes". Zenodo. [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13992091](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13992091)**

Instructions on how to integrate data and code are provided on the above Zenodo repository.

## 3. Analysis workflow
We recommend to run the scripts in the sequence as listed below.

**Data Preparation**
- Download the drone data from the Zenodo repository and extract it into the place holder folders.
- Run all R scripts in the `/scripts/prep` folder, following the numbering in the file names.

**Analyses**
- `scripts/analysis/1_predict_water.R` to generate the water masks.
- `scripts/analysis/2_filter_large_ponds.R` to filter out all ponds < 1m2 and assign ponds to time-series.
- `scripts/analysis/3_pond_time_series_analysis.R` for the analyses of individual pond change.
- `scripts/analysis/4_water_time_series_all.R` generate water proportion timeseries for the site and associated analysis.
- `scripts/analysis/5_climate_analysis.R` for all climate analyses (supplementary materials).
- `scripts/analysis/6_geolcoation.R` for the analysis of geolocation accouracy (supplementary materials).

**Figures / Tables**<br><br>
All figures in the main manuscript are generated using individual scripts named accordingly.<br><br>
The figures and tables presented in the supplementary materials are generated by the analysis scripts (above) or by the scripts for the figures in the main manuscript. Exceptions are indicated below. 
- Figure in main text: run `scripts/figures/X_figure_X.R` - where X is the number of the figure.
- Areal statistics for the AOIs can be generated using 'scripts/figures/aoi_summaries.R'.

**Generate Web-GIS**<br><br>
The Web-GIS can be generated automatically, as long as an AWS account is available. The latter is required for webhosting. Adapt and update the file locations and credentials accordingly. In-text comments in individual scripts and HTML pages provide guidance.  
- Update links and location references in `docs/index.html` and `docs/data_vis.html`.
- Run the scripts in `scripts/web-gis/` following the numbering indicateed in the file names.
